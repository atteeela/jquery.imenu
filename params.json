Freedom is in enormous\r\nflexibility, based on *simplicity* of implementation and in idea of\r\nminimalism — jquery.imenu gives you excellent control to your menus,\r\nbut not dictates how does it should like. (also imenu have some css\r\ntips and recommendations)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInclude jQuery and `jquery.imenu.min.js` onto your page:\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"jquery.imenu.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nDefault options are equal to this object:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        breakpoint: 600,\r\n        debug: false,\r\n        toggler: '.imenu__toggler',\r\n        classes: {\r\n            states: [ 'imenu_mode_mobile', 'imenu_mode_desktop' ],\r\n            mobile_states: [ 'imenu_mode_mobile-closed', 'imenu_mode_mobile-opened' ]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n* `breakpoint` *Pixels*, `600`  \r\n    \r\n    The switching point for imenu (in pixels). If window's width less\r\n    breakpoint then imenu will decide that curent window is opened\r\n    at mobile phone, and if else — at desktop.\r\n\r\n* `debug` *Boolean*, `false`  \r\n\r\n    If `true` will log important options, elems and important\r\n    events.\r\n\r\n* `toggler` *String*, `'.imenu__toggler'`  \r\n\r\n    Selector of toggler element of mobile version of menu.\r\n\r\n* `classes.states` *Array of two strings*, `[ 'imenu_state_mobile', 'imenu_state_desktop' ]`  \r\n    \r\n    Classes that used for reflecting main states of imenu-elements:\r\n    mobile or desktop mode. The first class is used for mobile, and\r\n    second for desktop versions. *At one time can be used only one of\r\n    these classes, because imenu-elements cannot exists in both modes\r\n    at one time.*\r\n\r\n* `classes.mobile_states` *Array of two strings*, `[ 'imenu_state_mobile-closed', 'imenu_state_mobile-opened' ]`  \r\n\r\n    Classes that used for reflecting sub-states of mobile state:\r\n    opened or closed menu. The first class is used for closed menu,\r\n    because default state of mobile menu is closed state. No one of\r\n    these classes don't exists in desktop state, that's why you can\r\n    use `.imenu_state_mobile-opened` selector and not be afraid to\r\n    affect to desktop menu. *Current `mobile_state` class would be\r\n    removed on switching to desktop and restored on switching back*\r\n\r\n## How does it work\r\n\r\njquery.imenu find the elements with `.imenu` class and executes on thme\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
